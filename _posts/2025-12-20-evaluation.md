## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Relative Accuracy

**The SzázKilencvenKilenc forecast proved to be one of the most accurate** among Hungarian polling institutes:

* **Fidesz popularity** : The 2.9 percentage point underestimation was the smallest deviation
* **Seat projection** : The 9-seat deviation (126 vs 135) was the most accurate forecast
* **Victory probability** : The 97.5% Fidesz victory probability was correct

### 2. Systematic Biases Across All Institutes

Every polling institute:

* **Underestimated Fidesz support** (by 3-7 percentage points)
* **Overestimated opposition support** (by 6-13 percentage points)
* **Underestimated Fidesz seat count** (by 9-18 seats)

This systematic error can likely be attributed to:

* Some Fidesz voters did not disclose their voting intention ("shy voters")
* More opposition supporters ultimately did not turn out to vote
* The electoral system provided a larger advantage to Fidesz than expected

## Methodological Lessons for the 2026 Forecast

1. **Accounting for Fidesz shy voters** : Based on 2022 experience, a 3-5 percentage point correction may be justified
2. **Cautious estimation of opposition mobilization** : Polls consistently overestimate opposition turnout
3. **More accurate modeling of electoral system effects** : Based on 2022 results, Fidesz's structural advantage is greater than previous models assumed
4. **Monitoring smaller parties (Mi Hazánk)** : After entering parliament in 2022, Mi Hazánk has become an important player
